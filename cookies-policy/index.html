            <h1> Cookies Policy</h1>

            <p>A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.</p>

            <p>In the following video from Google, you can see a very good explanation about how cookies work:</p>

            <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBR-xtJVq7E' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

            <h2>Google Analytics cookies</h2>

            <p>This site uses Google Analytics to understand better how you are using the site. My main goal with Google Analytics is to learn and improve my site so you can get the best of it.</p>

            <h2>Disabling cookies</h2>

            <p>However, if you want to disable the cookies in this site or other, I recommend you to check the help section of your web browser so you can disable them.</p>
