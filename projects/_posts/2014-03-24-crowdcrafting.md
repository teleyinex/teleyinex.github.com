The way we produce goods and provide services as a society is changing. We are
not just consumers anymore – we create videos, music, art, software, hardware
and much more, because the digital era has empowered us to do so. It’s easier
than ever before to be a producer. 

**So why don't we apply this model to how we do science too?**

[Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org) was born at a hackathon in Cape Town, South Africa in 2011.  It
is a free and open source alternative to existing citizen science platforms. In
partnership with our key collaborators, such as CERN, United Nations (UNITAR)
and the University of Geneva, we have reached out to and inspired many people
to get involved with science. And this is how we have achieved our goal of
transforming citizens from scientific consumers to scientific producers. 


## What is Crowdcrafting?
Crowdcrafting is a web-based service that invites volunteers to contribute to
scientific projects developed by citizens, professionals or institutions that
need help to solve problems, analyze data or complete challenging tasks that
can’t be done by machines alone, but require human intelligence. The platform
is 100% open source – that is its software is developed and distributed freely
– and 100% open-science, making scientific research accessible to everyone. 

Crowdcrafting uses PyBossa software: Our open source framework for
crowdsourcing projects. Institutions, such as the British Museum, CERN and
United Nations (UNITAR), are also PyBossa users.


## What is citizen science?
Citizen science is the active contribution of people who are not professional
scientists to science. It provides volunteers with the opportunity to
contribute intellectually to the research of others, to share resources or
tools at their disposal, or even to start their own research projects.
Volunteers provide real value to ongoing research while they themselves acquire
a better understanding of the scientific method. 

Citizen science opens the doors of laboratories and makes science accessible to
all. It facilitates a direct conversation between scientists and enthusiasts
who wish to contribute to scientific endeavour.


## How can you collaborate?
Anyone can create a new project or contribute to an existing project in
Crowdcrafting. All projects start with a simple tutorial explaining how they
work and providing all the information required to participate. There is thus
no specific knowledge or experience required to complete proposed tasks. All
volunteers need is a keen attitude to learn and share science with everyone.
