This [PyBossa](http://daniellombrana.es/pybossa.html) template application has been created to show how easy could be to transcribe locked in tables in PDF files.

The application loads a PDF file, using the [Mozilla PDF.JS library](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), allowing the users to render the PDF files without having to use any external pluging. Everything is rendered by the web browser.

Then, the application asks the user if there is a table, and how many columns has. Based on the answer, a new table will be created automatically where the user will be able to start transcribing the data cells.

The next video shows how simple it is to extract the data and save it in a structured format:
