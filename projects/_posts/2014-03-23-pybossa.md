PYBOSSA is an **open-source crowdsourcing platform** that allows researchers,
civic hackers and developers to create projects that need help to
solve problems, analyze data or complete challenging tasks that canâ€™t be done
by machines alone, but require human intelligence.

The source code is hosted in [Github](http://github.com/PYBOSSA) and it is
possible to fork it and run your own instance without problems. The project
provides several application templates like: 

 * **Image pattern recognition**: in this case, [Flickr Person Finder](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/flickrperson) that shows how you can classify pictures obtained from Flickr.
 * **Video pattern recognition**: using the popular website [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), you canalyze videos quite easily with this [template](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/vimeo).
 * **Sound Pattern recognition**: thanks to [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/) you can analyze audio clips, like distinguising accents or transcribing an audio with this [template](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/soundcloud).
 * **Geo-coging**: [Urban Parks](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/urbanpark) an application that shows you a web map that a volunteer has to browse in order to find an urban park.
 * **PDF file transcription**: [PDF transcribe](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe) a simple application that allows you to transcribe directly PDF files.

The PYBOSSA framework is used by international projects like:

 * [ForestWatchers.net](http://forestwatchers.net): they are assessing
     deforestation in the forests of the world, or the
 * [British Museum and UCL](http://micropasts.org): a crowdsourcing project for
     digitizing the bronze age.
