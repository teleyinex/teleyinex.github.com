This is a project where using photographs taken by the astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS), volunteers from all over the world
can help in classifying pictures to analyze light pollution in the cities.

The project started at the [ Citizen Cyberscience Summit ](http://cybersciencesummit.org/) as a prototype as a 
collaboration with the [UCM group of Extragalactic Astrophysics and Astronomical Instrumentation](guaix.fis.ucm.es). 

Right now is being developed as part of an ongoing workshop
in Medialab-Prado: [Madrid Laboratorio Urbano](http://medialab-prado.es/article/madridlaboratoriourbano).

The project uses the photograps taken by the astronoauts at the ISS, and then volunteers can help classifying them.

The classification is quite simple, the project offers 8 options:

 * Black
 * City
 * Stars
 * Aurora
 * Astronaut (yes you can see one of them there ;-))
 * None of these
 * No photo
 * I don't know
