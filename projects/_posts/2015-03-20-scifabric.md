After running several years the development of Crowdcrafting and PYBOSSA, I decided to create a company that will provide services around those two products as well as teaching about citizen science.

Scifabric develops open source software for crowdsourcing research.

We work with institutions on scientific research, the humanities, data journalism, medicine, education and much more.

We provide our clients with versatile tools, hosting services, development expertise, consultancy and training.

We also give courses and workshops about citizen science. Want to learn about citizen science? You're in the right place.


## Success stories

Clients like the British Museum, University College of London, CERN, Unitated Nations and others have trusted in our products and we show case some of them as part of our company:

 * [Crowdsourcing the Bronze Age](http://scifabric.com/success-stories/micropasts/)
 * [Crowdsourcing the analysis of light pollution from space](http://scifabric.com/success-stories/citiesatnight/)
