A very good friend of mine has been always sharing with me good articles to read. One day I asked him about
where did he find those posts, and he answered me: "In the Popular section of pinboard.in".

So I went there and found it. However, the UI was not really nice, specially on phones, so I decided to do
something about it: a simple dashboard using Vuejs + Bulma + Jekyll that will be fully responsive. Moreover,
it will allow you to save locally those posts that you like, without creating an account. How amazing is that?
